    {"property":"Radius(r)", "description":"Planets vary in size, even in our Solar System. Mercury has a radius of 2,440 km while Jupiter has a radius of 71,492 km. Planets are not perfect spheres, so the radius used is at the equator of the planet. The size of stars (stellar radii) can also vary. This is often given in terms of how much bigger than the Sun they are. For example, '2 solar radii' means twice the radius of the Sun."},

    {"property":"Mass(M)", "description":"If we want to, we can measure the mass of both planets and stars in kg. However, this gives us very big numbers to deal with. This is why you often see masses of exoplanets compared to the mass of the Earth, Jupiter. For example, 5 Earth masses, or 0.8 Jupiter masses."},
    {"property":"Density", "description":"If we know the mass and volume of an object, we can use ρ = M/V to calculate its density. This value tells us what the planet is made of and what it is like inside. A good material to compare it to is water which has a density of 1000 kg m-3."},
    {"property":"Albedo", "description":"This tells us how much light a planet or asteroid will reflect. This is useful if we want to work out what its surface is made of. Albedo values range from 0 (for a surface that absorbs all light) to 1 (for a surface that reflects all light). The average albedo of the Earth is around 0.3. However, this average includes values ranging from 0.04 for charcoal to 0.9 for fresh snow. "},
    {"property":"Temperature Surface(T)", "description":"This tells us how hot the outer layer is. However, we need to be careful when we refer to the surface of a planet or a star. Objects like stars or gas giants don't have surfaces. For example, we measure the temperature of Jupiter using its top layer of clouds. We measure the temperature of the Sun from the outer layers of its atmosphere."},
    {"property":"Orbital Period(P)", "description":"This is the time it takes an object to complete one full orbit of its star. This is usually given in terms of Earth days or years. In our Solar System, this varies from 88 days for Mercury up to around 248 years for the dwarf planet, Pluto."},
    {"property":"Eccentricity(e)", "description":"The orbits of all planets obey Kepler's First Law. This means that their orbit is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus. The eccentricity tells us how elliptical the orbit is. For completely circular orbits, the eccentricity is 0. The Earth has a value of 0.017 which means it is very close to a circle. Out of the 8 planets in the Solar System, Mercury has the most eccentric orbit with e = 0.201."},

This system for brightness is a bit complex but the key thing to know is that brighter objects have lower magnitudes. Magnitudes may be given for different wavelength ranges depending on which telescope filters have been used. Wavelengths you may see in this project are V (visible; the Sun's peak wavelength), I (very red light; close to the infrared), and J, H and K (infrared)."},
    {"property":"Planetary Parameter Reference", "description":"A Planetary Parameter Reference typically refers to a source that provides detailed information about various physical and orbital properties of a planet or a planetary system. These references are crucial for research in fields like orbital mechanics, astrodynamics, and exoplanetary studies. "},
    {"property":"Stellar Parameter Reference", "description":"A stellar parameter reference is a source or document that provides information about the key characteristics of a star. These parameters, such as temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity, are crucial for understanding and classifying stars. A stellar parameter reference might be a publication, a database, or another resource that contains these measurements for a specific star or a group of stars. "},

    {"property":"Transit","description":"The Transit method is a technique used to discover exoplanets by observing the slight dimming of a star's light when a planet passes in front of it. This method is particularly effective for detecting planets that orbit close to their host stars. The method allows astronomers to determine the size of the planet, the period of its orbit, and potentially the composition of its atmosphere."},
    {"property":"Radial Velocity","description":"The radial velocity method, also known as Doppler spectroscopy or the wobble method, is an exoplanet discovery technique based on measuring the gravitational wobble a star experiences due to an orbiting planet. This wobble causes the star's light to shift in wavelength (Doppler shift) as it moves towards or away from the observer. By analyzing these spectral shifts, astronomers can infer the presence and properties of exoplanets. This method is a powerful tool for exoplanet detection, particularly for finding giant planets that are relatively close to their stars, known as hot Jupiter's. It has played a significant role in discovering many exoplanets and provides valuable insights into their properties.  "},
    {"property":"Microlensing","description":"Microlensing is an indirect method of detecting exoplanets by observing the gravitational lensing effect of a star on a background star's light. When a star (the lens) passes in front of a more distant background star, its gravity warps the light from the background star, causing it to appear brighter and magnified. If the lens star has an exoplanet, the planet can also contribute to the lensing effect, creating a unique signature in the light curve of the background star. This signature allows astronomers to infer the presence and characteristics of the exoplanet. Microlensing is unique in its ability to detect planets at large distances and even rogue planets that aren't orbiting a star. It's particularly good at finding planets that are farther from their host stars than other methods can reach."},
    {"property":"Astrometry","description":"Astrometry, in the context of exoplanet discovery, is a method that precisely measures a star's position in the sky over time to detect the subtle wobble caused by an orbiting planet. This wobble occurs because both the star and the planet orbit a common center of mass, which leads to a periodic shift in the star's apparent position against the background stars. Astrometry can help determine the mass and orbital characteristics of exoplanets, which is crucial for understanding their formation and evolution. Astrometry is also used to confirm exoplanets discovered by other methods and to provide more precise measurements of planetary orbits."},
    {"property":"Imaging","description":"Imaging is an exoplanet discovery method that involves capturing images of exoplanets by directly observing the light reflected from their atmospheres. It's a challenging technique because planets are faint compared to their host stars, but advances in technology, like using infrared wavelengths where the contrast is less stark, have made it possible. Direct imaging is a relatively rare method compared to other methods like the transit and radial velocity methods, which have detected a vast number of exoplanets. "},
    {"property":"Disk Kinematics","description":"Disk kinematics refers to the study of the motions and dynamics of gas and dust within proto planetary disks, which are the building blocks of planetary systems. This method indirectly detects exoplanets by observing how a planet's gravitational influence perturbs the disk's structure and motion. In essence, disk kinematics allows astronomers to see the gravitational fingerprints of planets on the surrounding disks, even when the planets themselves are invisible. "},
    {"property":"Transit Timing Variations","description":"Transit Timing Variations (TTV) is an exoplanet detection method that utilizes the gravitational influence of unseen planets on the orbits of other transiting planets to infer their presence. By observing variations in the timing of transits, astronomers can detect subtle perturbations caused by the gravitational pull of other planets in the system. In essence, TTVs provide a fingerprint of unseen planets, allowing astronomers to indirectly detect and characterize them even when they don't transit the star directly. "},
    {"property":"Pulsation Timing Variations","description":"Pulsation Timing Variations (PTV) is an exoplanet detection method that utilizes the timing of a star's pulsations to identify the presence of an orbiting planet. By monitoring the stable oscillations of pulsating stars, astronomers can detect the subtle gravitational tugs exerted by unseen planets, causing periodic changes in the timing of the pulsations. By analyzing the patterns of timing variations, astronomers can infer the presence of the exoplanet and potentially estimate its orbital parameters. In essence, PTV leverages the precision of stellar pulsation timing to detect the subtle, but measurable, gravitational effects of unseen planets, offering a unique and sensitive approach to exoplanet discovery."},
    {"property":"Eclipse Timing Variations","description":"Eclipse Timing Variations (ETV) is an exoplanet discovery method that detects the presence of planets in binary star systems by observing variations in the timing of eclipses. These variations, caused by the gravitational pull of an unseen planet, disrupt the otherwise predictable orbital periods of the binary stars. ETVs are particularly useful for detecting planets orbiting around both stars of the binary, known as circumbinary planets. "},
    {"property":"Orbital Brightness Modulation","description":"Orbital brightness modulation is an exoplanet discovery method that relies on detecting changes in a star's brightness caused by the planet itself. When a large, reflective planet orbits close to its host star, the changes in reflected light can cause the star's brightness to fluctuate in sync with the planet's orbital period. Astronomers can detect these subtle changes in brightness by carefully monitoring a star's light over time. Once a periodic brightness modulation is detected, it can be used to infer the presence of a planet and determine its orbital characteristics."},
    {"property":"Pulsar Timing","description":"Pulsar timing is an exoplanet discovery method that leverages the incredibly precise and regular pulses emitted by pulsars. By carefully measuring the arrival times of these pulses, scientists can detect subtle variations caused by the gravitational tug of an orbiting exoplanet, revealing its presence and orbital characteristics. This method was instrumental in discovering the first confirmed exoplanets outside our solar system. Pulsar timing can also be used to detect gravitational interactions between multiple planets in a system, providing information about their relative positions and masses. In 1992, astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail used pulsar timing to discover planets around the pulsar PSR B1257+12, making it the first confirmation of planets outside the solar system.
