Project Proposal: Planet Pal Website
Project Subject
Planet Pal is an educational and interactive website that explores the fascinating world of exoplanets—planets beyond our solar system. 
The platform aims to inspire curiosity about space science and astronomy through engaging visuals, simplified scientific explanations, 
and interactive learning tools.

Project Description
Planet Pal is a web-based platform designed to make the study of exoplanets fun and accessible for students, space enthusiasts, 
and the general public. The website will feature:

Exoplanet Profiles: A growing catalog of real exoplanets discovered by space telescopes like Kepler and TESS, 
each with a profile showing its size, distance, temperature, and potential habitability.

Interactive Star Map: A visual tool to explore star systems and their exoplanets in 3D space.

Learning Hub: Articles, videos, and infographics explaining concepts like transit method, radial velocity, habitable zones, 
and planetary types (gas giants, super-Earths, etc.).

Build-a-Planet Game: A simulation where users create their own exoplanet and see how changes in size, orbit, 
and atmosphere affect its environment.

News & Discoveries: A blog-style section highlighting the latest findings in exoplanet research and astronomy missions.

Planet Pal Quizzes and Challenges: To test knowledge and encourage deeper exploration of the content.

The site will be mobile-friendly and styled with a space-themed design to spark imagination and discovery.

Project Reason and Purpose
The purpose of the Planet Pal website is to make exoplanet science approachable and exciting, 
particularly for young learners and those new to astronomy.
Key reasons for this project include:

Promoting STEM Education: Space exploration is a gateway to broader interest in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).

Public Engagement: With missions like JWST and TESS capturing the world’s attention, 
there is a growing interest in exoplanets that needs accessible educational content.

Filling the Knowledge Gap: Many educational websites are either too technical or overly simplified. 
Planet Pal bridges that gap with accurate, interactive, and age-appropriate material.

Encouraging Curiosity: By letting users explore real and imaginary worlds, 
Planet Pal fuels imagination and the human desire to explore the universe.
